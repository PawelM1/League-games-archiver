# League games archiver
The application was developed as part of the "Databases" subject. Its task is to save the course of any league tournament.

The main assumption was to write the functionality in PL/SQL language and the user interface, which was to use PL/SQL language, hence the application is not fully optimized, as it connects to the database with each operation.

The interface was written using JavaFx, the Oracle database connects to the interface via Hibernate.
